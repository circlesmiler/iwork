# iWork - Work Time Recognizing on Particle Photon
This is a Particle Photon project. The idea is to provide a simple display
and a login and logout button to recognize the start work time end the end
of work.

On the display, you can see following informations:
 * Start of Work (hh:mm)
 * End of Work (hh:mm)
 * Time at Work (hh:mm)
 * Current Time (hh:mm)
 * WIFI strength (as Image)
 * Outside Temperature (OpenWeather API)
